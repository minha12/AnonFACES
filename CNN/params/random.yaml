# A simple gen file to produce a image with random, unconstrained parameters.

mode: random        # Use mode 'random' to produce random images

constrained: True  # Unconstrain parameters, allowing "illegal" inputs.
                    # Typically the inputs are constrained to unit length (or
                    # satisfy [sin(x) cos(x)] for orientation), but disabling
                    # this allows for some wild, unexpected generations.

id_scale: 2.0       # Scale the identity vector by 2
em_scale: 1       # Scale the emotion vector by 2 as well

num_images: 100     # Produce one hundred random images
